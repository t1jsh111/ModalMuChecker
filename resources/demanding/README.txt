The files demanding_children_x.mcf contain the LTSs for x demanding children.

Note: the LTSs describe three types of actions of a fixed, arbitrary
child (say child 1) and abstract from all other children.  As a
result, there are four types of actions in all LTSs:

* act 'ask': represents the change of state of child 1 from playing to
  questioning mode
* act 'wisdom': represents the change of state of child 1 from
  questioning mode to receiving answer mode
* act 'playing': represents the change of state of child 1 from 
  receiving answer mode to playing mode
* act 'i': represents the changes of state of all other children
