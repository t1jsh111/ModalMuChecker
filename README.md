# ModalMuChecker

ModalMuChecker is a C++ library for checking modal mu formulas on Labeled Transition Systems.

The library can read LTSs in the Aldebran format (https://www.mcrl2.org/web/user_manual/language_reference/lts.html#aldebaran-format)

The library is able to check formulas using the traditional algorithm based on the modal mu semantics, and the improved Emerson-Lei algorithm

In main.cpp one can see an example of checking a formula on an LTS.
